<h1>My name is Eric Cheong Kai Kit</h1>

I have a website called www.ericcheongkaikit.com. Please to meet you!

<h2>What am I doing now?</h2>

I am a developer and look forward to learning all the time! Currently, I am currently learing Go (by building a project), putiting my Node fundamentals to practice (by also building another project) and completing a tiny frontend project! (sliding images of Japan)
<br>

<h3>Achievements</h3>
1. Scratch the surface of Node.js and its framework - Express.js!
<br>

<h3>Proud to have finished</h3>

* [x] I am currently learning Node.js purely out of interest. All my notes and where/how I've accumulated them can be seen in my `node-fundamentals` repository

<h3>In progress</h3>
- A tool built with the MERN stack (will be a simple budgeting tool that I will use) <br>
- A tiny frontend project with images of Japan! <br>
- Another tool for my fitness workouts with the MERN stack as well 

<h3>Wishlist</h3>
- A project to collect coordinates of parking spots possibly with React and Go <br>
- Desktop tool that saves shortcuts for user to refer back to. I have yet to decide framework to use for this
