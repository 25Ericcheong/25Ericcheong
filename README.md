<h1>My name is Eric Cheong Kai Kit</h1>

I have a website called www.ericcheongkaikit.com. Please to meet you!

<h2>What am I doing now?</h2>

I am a developer and look forward to learning all the time! Currently, I am currently learing Go!
<br>

<h3>Achievements</h3>
1. Scratch the surface of Node.js and its framework - Express.js!
<br>

<h3>Proud to have finished</h3>

* [x] I am currently learning Node.js purely out of interest. All my notes and where/how I've accumulated them can be seen in my `node-fundamentals` repository

<h3>Put on hold (Not Proud)</h3>
- To build a project with the MERN stack (will probably be used to remember places of where I want to go eat and where I have been eating)
<br>
- Complete tiny frontend project with images of Japan!
