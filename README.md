# My name is Eric Cheong Kai Kit #

I have a website called www.ericcheongkaikit.com. Please to meet you!

## What am I doing now? ##

I want to solve problems and build things! I am currently Golang-ing and completing a tiny frontend project! (sliding images of Japan with fun features included)
<br>

### In Progress ###
* A tool built with Go (used to log my daily achievements / what I've learnt)
* A tiny frontend project with images of Japan!
* A little Go script to remind me of peoples' birthday

### Wishlist ###
* A project to collect coordinates of parking spots possibly because I hate parking and not being able to locate one prior to driving annoys me 
* Desktop tool that saves shortcuts for user to refer back to. I have yet to decide framework to use for this
