# My name is Eric Cheong Kai Kit #

I have a website called www.ericcheongkaikit.com. Please to meet you!

## What am I doing now? ##

I want to solve problems and build things! I am currently putting my Node fundamentals to practice (by building another project to log my daily achievements or highlights; quite literally), Golang-ing, and completing a tiny frontend project! (sliding images of Japan with fun features included)
<br>

### Achievements ###
1. Scratch the surface of Node.js and its framework - Express.js!

### Proud to have Finished ###

* [x] I am currently learning Node.js purely out of interest. All my notes and where/how I've accumulated them can be seen in my `node-fundamentals` repository
* [x] Learning MongoDB via the MongoDB University

### In Progress ###
* A tool built with Express and TypeScript (used to log my daily achievements / what I've learnt)
* A tiny frontend project with images of Japan!
* A little Go script to remind me of peoples' birthday

### Wishlist ###
* A project to collect coordinates of parking spots possibly because I hate parking and not being able to locate one prior to driving annoys me 
* Desktop tool that saves shortcuts for user to refer back to. I have yet to decide framework to use for this 
* Another tool for my fitness workouts with the MERN stack
