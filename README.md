<h1>My name is Eric Cheong Kai Kit</h1>

I have a website called www.ericcheongkaikit.com. Please to meet you!

<h2>What am I doing now?</h2>

I want to solve problems and build things! I am currently putting my Node fundamentals to practice (by building another project to log my daily achievements or highlights; quite literally), Golang-ing, and completing a tiny frontend project! (sliding images of Japan with fun features included)
<br>

<h3>Achievements</h3>
1. Scratch the surface of Node.js and its framework - Express.js!
<br>

<h3>Proud to have Finished</h3>

* [x] I am currently learning Node.js purely out of interest. All my notes and where/how I've accumulated them can be seen in my `node-fundamentals` repository

<h3>In Progress</h3>
- A tool built with Express and TypeScript (used to log my daily achievements / what I've learnt) <br>
- A tiny frontend project with images of Japan! <br>
- Another tool for my fitness workouts with the MERN stack as well <br>
- Learning MongoDB via the MongoDB University

<h3>Wishlist</h3>
- A project to collect coordinates of parking spots possibly because I hate parking and not being able to locate one prior to driving annoys me <br>
- Desktop tool that saves shortcuts for user to refer back to. I have yet to decide framework to use for this <br>
- Another tool for my fitness workouts with the MERN stack
